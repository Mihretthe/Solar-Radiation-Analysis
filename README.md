# Solar Radiation Analysis


## Overview
The Solar Radiation Analysis project is designed to analyze and visualize solar radiation data across various countries. This repository includes Jupyter notebooks for country-specific analyses and a Streamlit-based web application for interactive data exploration.

## Structure
- `app/`: Contains the Streamlit web application.
- `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks for in-depth data analysis.
- `scripts/`: Helper functions for data processing.
- `tests/`: Unit tests to ensure code reliability.

## Features
- Streamlit Dashboard for interactive EDA.
- Country-specific analysis using Jupyter Notebooks.
- Data visualization for solar radiation patterns.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Solar-Radiation-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd Solar-Radiation-Analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
- Streamlit App: Navigate to the app directory and run:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
- Jupyter Notebooks: Open and run the notebooks in the notebooks directory for specific analyses.
## Data
The project uses solar radiation data stored in CSV files. Ensure you place the data in the appropriate directory before running the app or notebooks.
